## 🚨 Quick Fixes to Try:

### **Fix 1: Resave All Searches**
- Edit each saved search slightly (change price by $1)
- Re-save with email alerts enabled
- This often refreshes the email system

### **Fix 2: Create Broader Test Searches**
- Price: $50K - $20M (very wide)
- Location: NYC + 100 miles
- All business types
- Should generate immediate test emails

### **Fix 3: Contact Platform Support**
If still no emails after 48 hours:
- BizBuySell: support@bizbuysell.com
- BizQuest: support@bizquest.com  
- DealStream: support@dealstream.com

Ask: "I set up saved search alerts but am not receiving email notifications"

- [ ] Received confirmation email after saving search
- [ ] Getting daily/weekly digest emails (even if empty)
